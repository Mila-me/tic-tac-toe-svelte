# tic-tac-toe-svelte
A humble tic-tac-toe game in svelte, without db, but with leaderboard and results history.

Created to test some stuff in svelte.

To run use npm, first build then run (copy public to your server) or start in dev mode with: npm run --dev, if you want to edit something in the fly.
